Dear, {{username}}

You may be going all out and organising a themed children’s party for your little one’s birthday, so the first step is to create matching kids party invitations. Some of our illustrated designs may give away the party theme straight away, such as the fairytale castle on our “Castle in the Clouds” kids party invitations, whilst for more subtle designs you can play with your kids party invitation wording to hint at the party theme. Take a look below for some kids party invitation wording suggestions for a host of different party themes.

Your Faithfully,
Darshan Khunt
